1: I heard a thousand blended notes,
2: While in a grove I sate reclined,
3: In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
4: Bring sad thoughts to the mind.
5: 
6: To her fair works did Nature link
7: The human soul that through me ran;
8: And much it grieved my heart to think
9: What man has made of man.
10: 
11: Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,
12: The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;
13: And ’tis my faith that every flower
14: Enjoys the air it breathes.
15: 
16: The birds around me hopped and played,
17: Their thoughts I cannot measure:—
18: But the least motion which they made
19: It seemed a thrill of pleasure.

24: That there was pleasure there.
25: 
26: If this belief from heaven be sent,
27: If such be Nature’s holy plan,
28: Have I not reason to lament
29: What man has made of man?
